1 Data Issues
While exploring the data I found and corrected the following issues:
I found that some responses had very few of the questions answered. I elected to fix it by
deleting all responses that failed to answer more than 4 of the questions. I felt this was a valid
way to fix it because there were very few responses that this applied to and most of the responses
that it did apply to were outliers.
I found that some responses did not answer every question. I elected to fix it by finding the most
common value in that column and replacing the empty response with that value. I felt this was a
valid way to fix it because there were very few responses that this applied to and because it is
categorical data so the average answer isn't easily skewed.

2 My Questions
2.1 Are liberals more likely to have grown up with liberal adults
This question was of interest to me because there is normally a correlation between a child's
values and their parents values. I investigated it by creating a contingency table to demonstrate
the frequency that someone answered that they saw themselves as mildly or strongly liberal and
if people answered that the adults they grew up with as mildly or strongly liberal. I used this
contingency table to perform a Chi-squared test for independence. It seems like there is a
correlation between people who are liberals and the adults they grew up with being liberals. This
is because the p value was very small showing that the alternative hypothesis is correct. I think
this is because growing up you learn everything from people you look up to, like adults, so kids
based their personal values on the adults that raised them.

2.2 Do females and males tend to disagree in their responses?
This question was of interest to me because I thought that maybe females would side more with
the female characters in each scenario and the males with the males in each scenario. I
investigated it by creating two gorgeous graphs to demonstrate the frequency of type of response
for each gender. It seems like there was no correlation between gender and response. This is
because the graphs look very similar to each other, meaning that each question had similar
responses whether the person was a male or female. I think this is because some of the scenarios
were more obvious who is the jerk and also almost all of the people who took the survey are
around the same age and all are educated so they think somewhat alike regardless of gender.

2.3 Are compassionate people more likely to side with the mom? in column 16
This question was of interest to me because people who think they are more compassionate
might tend to feel compassion towards a mom who is trying to do the right thing. I investigated it
by creating a contingency table to demonstrate the frequency that someone answered that they
are compassionate and if their response for column 16 was agreeing with the mom. I used this
contingency table to perform a Chi-squared test for independence. It seems like there is not a
correlation between people who answered that they are compassionate and people who agreed
with the mom in this scenario. This is because the p value was larger than .05 so we could not
reject the null hypothesis. I think this is because people in their 20s don't know what it's like to
be a mom and it could be hard for this age range of people to put himself in the moms shoes
